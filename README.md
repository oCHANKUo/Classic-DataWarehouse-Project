# Classic-DataWarehouse-Project
This repository contains my Data Warehouse Assessment project, built to design, implement, and demonstrate a working data warehouse environment.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and populate a star-schema-based data warehouse from structured data provided to me. Data was in the form of SQL Source documents, Text files and Excel files. The project simulates a real-world ETL process, data modeling, and visualization pipeline.
