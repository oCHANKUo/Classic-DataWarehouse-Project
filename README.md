# Classic-DataWarehouse-Project
This repository contains my Data Warehouse Assessment project, built to design, implement, and demonstrate a working data warehouse environment.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and populate a star-schema-based data warehouse from structured data provided to me. Data was in the form of SQL Source documents, Text files and Excel files. The project simulates a real-world ETL process, data modeling, and visualization pipeline.

# Key Features
**Data Modeling** – Created a star schema with fact and dimension tables (e.g., DimSalesPerson, DimProduct, DimCustomer, FactSales).
**ETL Pipeline** – Extracted, transformed, and loaded data into the warehouse using SQL scripts.
**Surrogate Keys & Identity Columns** – Implemented surrogate keys for dimension tables to ensure data integrity.
**Data Cleaning** – Removed inconsistencies and ensured referential integrity across tables.
**Business Analysis** – Prepared data for sales trend, top product, and performance reporting. (Not included in the GitHub repo)
**BI Integration** – Designed Power BI dashboards for interactive visual analysis. (Not included in the GitHub repo)
